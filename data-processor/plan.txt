## Development Assignments

### Assignment 1: Basic Market Data Fetcher

**Objective**: Create a simple program that retrieves stock data from a public API.

**Tasks**:

1. Research free financial APIs (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, etc.)
2. Define a structure to hold stock quote information
3. Implement a function to fetch data for a single stock symbol
4. Parse the JSON response into your defined structure
5. Print the results to the console

**Learning Goals**:

- HTTP requests in Go
- JSON parsing
- Error handling
- Basic data structures

### Assignment 2: Multi-Symbol Data Processor

**Objective**: Extend your program to handle multiple stock symbols concurrently.

**Tasks**:

1. Modify your program to accept a list of stock symbols
2. Implement concurrent data fetching using goroutines
3. Collect results from multiple API calls
4. Handle errors properly for each request
5. Format and display combined results

**Learning Goals**:

- Concurrency with goroutines
- Synchronization with WaitGroups
- Working with slices and maps

### Assignment 3: Periodic Data Collection

**Objective**: Transform your program into a service that collects data at regular intervals.

**Tasks**:

1. Set up a timer to trigger data collection periodically
2. Implement graceful shutdown handling
3. Add logging to track operations
4. Create a simple mechanism to store collected data
5. Implement basic error recovery and retries

**Learning Goals**:

- Working with time and timers in Go
- Service design patterns
- Basic persistence strategies
- Signal handling

### Assignment 4: Data Normalization and Processing

**Objective**: Enhance your service to process and normalize data from different sources.

**Tasks**:

1. Add support for a second data source/API
2. Create adapter functions to normalize data from different sources
3. Implement filtering for invalid or missing data
4. Add calculation of basic technical indicators (e.g., moving averages)
5. Structure the data for consumption by other system components

**Learning Goals**:

- Interface design
- Data transformation patterns
- Basic financial calculations
- Modular code organization

## Getting Started

For Assignment 1, begin by:

1. Researching the Alpha Vantage API documentation
2. Understanding the structure of their Global Quote endpoint
3. Sketching out the Go structures needed to represent this data
4. Planning your HTTP request function
